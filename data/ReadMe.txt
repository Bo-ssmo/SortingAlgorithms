If you want to run this projekt on your own, you'll need to download SFML and put it in here.
Because I couldn't upload the projekt with the SFML files.

You need to create the following paths in here:
SFML/include
SFLM/lib

The "include" and "lib" folders are found in the downloaded SFML file.

And you need to put all the dll files from SFML/bin into the directory with the source code.
